I understood the problem so that once the class was used to make an object,
the path and parameters would be set so that they are not changeable unless
the entire URI would be changed. If the given URI is invalid, the path and/or
parameters are assigned to null. If parameters are assigned to null, the URI is
invalid.

Quite early on in implementing the class, I realized that if I hard-coded the given
scheme, paths, and requirements to the class itself, it would be afterwards very
inconvenient to change them. So I decided to write all of them to a configuration
file that would be easy to change. I also made it easy to add different types of
requirements later.

Another challenge was that I wasn't sure what kind of client was asked here.
Node.js server or a web application didn't seem to be what was intended. So
I just made some test cases that show that the class works.

Currently, the class doesn't give any feedback on what was the problem if the
URI was invalid. Return values could indicate for example what was wrong with
the parameters.
